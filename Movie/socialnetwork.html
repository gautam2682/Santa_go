                              <p class="w3-text-white">Mark Zuckerberg creates a social networking site, Facebook, with the help of his                                 friend Eduardo Saverin. But soon, a string of lies tears their relationship apart even as Facebook                                   connects people.

           The film revolved around intellectual property, ethics, lawsuits and relationships. It sure sounds like a difficult film to produce but I’m glad to say I enjoyed myself throughout and may even plan to watch it again, just so I might learn something I hadn’t observed the first time round.

The founders of Facebook probably do not agree fully to this film. We should understand for dramatic effect, parts of the movie would have been exaggerated and probably twisted. Aside from a strong impulse to learn programming after watching the film, here are some insights I gained:
            
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">1. Always have a long term plan</h2>
          In the beginning, Saverin was aggressively getting advertisers in attempts to monetise Facebook. But Zuckerbergwas firm on his decision that Facebook would not make money from ads. Facebook was cool precisely because there were no ads; Zuckerberghad planned that making money was not his priority in the early stages of Facebook but producing a great product.

I do think Facebook had majorly re-invented web advertising, alongside with Google. By allowing marketers to target their audience using data volunteered by users themselves (such as demographics, interests, activities), social media has unlocked endless potential for businesses and even the non-profit industry.

            </div>
             
              <h2 class="w3-text-blue" >2. When you have a great product, money finds you. </h2>
When you've created a great product that gives great value and is of service to your consumers, they will tell their friends. If you keep delivering the same high level of value and also constantly improve the value you are giving, money will find you. Money will find you from your consumers as well as your investors. Investors want to invest in companies with momentum and a story. Because of the Internet and relatively low costs and barriers to enter into many businesses these days, investors want more than an idea. Consumers can't buy an idea; they can only buy hard goods and services. Focus on making the product as amazing as possible and it will begin to sell itself. Let money chase you; don't chase the money.
                <div class="center">
            <img  src="socialnetwork/money.jpg%20" alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">3. It's not about who has an idea but who can execute it.</h2>
There's a phrase that says, "There are no original ideas." Also, a lot of mystics, saints and sages believe that all human beings are tapped into the "Universal Mind" and that we all have access to the same ideas and inspiration. It's all about who is listening and who has the chops to pull it off.

Aaron Sorkin, the writer of "The Social Network," has said that no one knows the exact truth of what happened between Zuckerberg, the Winklevai and Saverin. But the truth is in the outcome. Facebook happened because Mark Zuckerberg had the chops, the confidence, the vision and the discipline to make it happen. So if you have a big idea, you should know that you probably aren't the only one. Your job is to get busy making it happen. Look how fast Zuckerberg created and put Facebook online. It wasn't years of slaving away; it was weeks of hard work to create the first version -- the most important weeks of his life.

            <img  src="socialnetwork/idea.jpg%20" alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4. Visualize success as your final result. </h2>
          One of the great things about "The Social Network" is that from the beginning, you know that success is on the other end of Zuckerberg's efforts. 

That gives a wonderful perspective for the viewer, because we know that no matter what struggles he went through, the end result was success. This is a great view to take on your life. No matter what struggles you have in your life, see it all working out and that success will be your end result. It might work on idea one or idea 10,000, but the important thing is to keep success in mind and know that is how your story will end if you choose it to be.

            </div>
           
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">5. Leave School If You Must. </h2>
           Look at Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg? They dropped out of school and never went back. Sometimes, there are more important things than paperchase.The lesson here is that being pulled by the inspiration of a big idea within you is more important than doing what the "system" tells you to do. My advice is to follow your dreams, and as you go along, surround yourself with the smartest and most talented people you can find. 
Dropping out of school is a big risk. You have to to have a major belief in yourself and the determination and persistence of a warrior. It's not an easy path, but for people like me, it's the only path.

You can always go back to college later in life after having gained so much from your life experience in the real world.
