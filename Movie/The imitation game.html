          The movie “The Imitation Game” is based on a true story. It depicts how the secretly gay British mathematician (Alan Turing) and his team saved an estimated 14 million lives during World War II by building a computer that cracked the Nazis’ supposedly unbreakable “Enigma” encryption code. Here are lessons you definitly want to learn:- 
           
                       <h2 class="w3-text-blue">1. Welcome the Outsider</h2>
          Midway through The Imitation Game Turing hires a woman for his all-male team simply because 25-year-old Cambridge University graduate Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) solved a test crossword puzzle faster than all her rivals. "The prejudice at the time was extraordinary because sexism was institutionalized and built into the law," Tyldum says. "One important thing the movie shows is that Turing embraced people who were seen as being outsiders, who were different kind of thinkers."

Clarke becomes a key member of the "Hut 8" operation. "Turing looked past prejudice, which then allows you to do new and brilliant and great things. You do not move forward by following convention. You celebrate those who are different, who are not burdened by 'normality.'"
           
            <div class="center w3-margin">
            <img  src="imitation/outsider.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>


            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">2. Do not act like an ass</h2>
            A loner by temperament, Turing isolates himself to obsess over the bronze, copper, and wire "Bombe" contraption he's built to beat Enigma. Helen upbraids him for leaving his collaborators in the dark, saying: "I'm a woman so I can't afford to behave like an ass but neither can you. You need help and the only way you're going to get it is to make them like you."

The next day Turing passes out apples to his co-workers and clumsily tells a joke. The gesture is appreciated and shortly thereafter, Turing’s most talented colleague Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) makes a critical improvement to Bombe electro-mechanics. "Alan was very much a man who kept to himself and sort of pushed away other people," Tyldum says. "Joan makes him understand that he has to bring other people into his world in order to solve EnigmaI. The Imitation Game shows how important it is to have this uncompromising drive, but you also need to work together with other people."
            <div class="center w3-margin">
            <img  src="imitation/loner.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
             
              <h2 class="w3-text-blue" >3.Think big even when it hurts</h2>
When Turing and his team finally break the code, they face a brutal dilemma: if the Allies immediately act on intercepted messages to stop German attacks, the Nazis will realize their code has been broken and change tactics accordingly. In the film, Turin decides "Our job isn't to break Enigma. Our job is to win the war." For the next four years, he insists that Britain conceal the sources of its intelligence. Tyldum observes, "Sometimes you can’t afford to do what is human, you have to do what is logical. Turing had this very logical mind. He wasn’t thinking about emotions in the same way as most people. MI6 created fake double agents, leaked rumors to Nazis about German officers who partied too much in Paris and did all kinds of things to camouflage the fact that Turing had actually broken Enigma."
                <div class="center w3-margin">
              <img  src="imitation/big.jpg" alt="love">
               </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4. Do good work and get good work </h2>
            In 1939 Turing survives a tense job interview and lands work at the government's secret code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park in the south of England. Turing gets hired not because he's likable but because his resume includes a scholarly paper establishing him as England's reigning expert on artificial intelligence. Tyldum says, "This is a man who was 23 years old when he theorized the idea of creating a programmable machine and in that way, Turing foresaw computers and artificial intelligence. These were revolutionary ideas at that time."
              <div class="center w3-margin">
                <img  src="imitation/big.gif" alt="love">
               </div>
            
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">5. Brabvery is deemed to pay</h2>
            Turing needs 100,000 pounds to build the thinking machine that would perform the work of hundreds of men in a matter of hours. When his boss, Naval Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) denies the request, Turing writes a letter directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and quickly receives the funding along with a job promotion. "Turing was fearless," Tyldum says. "He’s extremely direct, which can be seen as socially awkward, and that becomes both his big obstacle but also in many ways his strength.".
