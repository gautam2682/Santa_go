           American sniper is one of the best documentries ever made in history.It's a movie about a blind patrotism (chauvinism) ,a movie about 
           balancing family and job and above all saving people  lives.It's a saga of Navy Seal and how they keep service before self .Some lessons          worth noting are:-
           
                       <h2 class="w3-text-blue">1. Do what you love in lfe</h2>
           Of course this magic quote have the power to change the whole life of a person.Tt is said that a person need atleast 10000 hrs to master an art and this can be done only if you truly love what you do in life as it is also true with finding love of your life. The sooner you get both things in life the larger you will achieve in your life time . So discover the true self within you.
             Crish kyle  oncequoted:-<br><span class="w3-blockquote">The thing we all had in common wasn’t muscle; it was the will to do whatever it takes.” - Chris Kyle"</span><br>

            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">1. Become a Master of Your Craft</h2>
            If you want to rise to greatness as Chris Kyle did, it is not enough to settle for being good at what you profess yourself to be an expert at. Chris pushed himself hard, and you could see it in his actions and his performance record. He hated failure because failure meant an American soldier’s death, and he was always torn up when one of his comrades fell. Not only does he have an impressive kill count, he was able to do so at amazing distances that others would not be able to believe. He was able to fell an enemy combatant at an impressive distance of over 1,920 meters. That is over a mile away.

              <h2 class="w3-text-blue" >2.Courage is a Series of Actions </h2>
Courage is not only about doing the right thing, it’s about doing the right thing over and over again in the face of obstacles. It is pretty widely known that Chris Kyle has a confirmed kill count of around 160 enemy combatants, possibly exponentially more. However, the knowledge of his injuries that he sustained to rack up that record-breaking enemy kill count is far less known. To his credit, Kyle’s SEAL insignia contains five Bronze Star Medals with Combat Valor, two Silver Stars, and a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat. During his tours, he escaped six improvised-explosive-device attacks, received three bullet wounds, narrowly escaped two crashes inside of helicopters, and has had to undergo countless surgeries. To his comrades and those he protected, he was a selfless and courageous protector. He even achieved living legend status with the apt nickname “The Legend.” After each injury, he fought to get back to where he could be of use.

            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">3. Perspective matters  </h2>
            In life, truth and reality exist independently of us; however, we can only experience these things through our world view. Our perspective matters because it dictates how we perceive the world and, therefore, how we act in it. Many disagreed that Chris was a hero and said he was as a coward and a cold-blooded killer. Putting politics aside, Chris did not let this chorus of anger lead him astray from his mission. He stayed focused and put those words behind him. For Chris, every enemy fell, an American soldier would be coming back home, and holding on to this perspective is what made him so laser focused in his duty. When you believe that your goal has immense weight and importance, you will put all your strength and resources into succeeding. Make your goal matter a lot.

            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4.Be Mature and Strong Enough to Make Big Compromises </h2>
            After a while, the burden of responsibility can wear down even the most hardened of steel warriors, especially when there are not enough hours in the day to fulfill all promised duties. Chris was a father, a husband, and a member of one of the most elite fighting forces on the planet. Each one of these jobs requires great time and sacrifice. But one of the biggest decisions we have to make in our lives is what takes priority. Who and what do we owe our lives to?

As much as he loved being with his comrades, saving lives, and thriving in adverse conditions, he knew the family he had at home could not wait forever. He left the Navy SEALS to come home to be with his family.
