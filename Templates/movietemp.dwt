            Intersteller is  definately a movie beyond the horizons of mankind ,  a movie of its own kind  . This movie  beautifuly potrays a 
            picture of what can happen in near future supported by facts and figures.A emotional  engaging story with eternal love for family.
            A movie in which at last you will be compelled in the end to search for the things that you can't understand.So here are lessons 
            worth to learn.
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">1. Love is powerful</h2>
            Interstellar was more than just a movie about space and discovery. It was a movie about eternal love.
            Once in the movie  Like Brand said, <br><span class="w3-blockquote">Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends              time and            space."</span><br>
            This movie actually showed us that love is more powerful than anything in this world. Love is what allows us to go beyond our limits.              It's when we do things out of love that we are able to create the most beautiful things on earth.
            <div class="center img-responsive">
            <img  src="../Movie/intersteller/love.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
             
              <h2 class="w3-text-blue" >2. There are many more secrets left to be discovered </h2>

              Interstellar showed us that there are many more things to discover in this world. There could be planets in another galaxy with                different species. There could be an alternate universe where there are 72 hours in a day. Yet, we will never know until we look              beyond what we know.

              It's a challenge for us to think about the possibilities beyond the Earth we live in. It's a challenge for us to ask questions that go              beyond what people tell us. And this is the beauty in life: there's always something left to discover; there are always new places to               travel to, new people to meet, and new secrets to unlock. And why can't we be the ones to discover it?
                <div class="center">
            <img  src="../Movie/intersteller/secret.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">3. "Whatever can happen, will happen" -- Murphy's Law </h2>

              Murphy's law typically states that, "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong," but like Cooper said, "Murphy's law doesn't mean that something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen, will happen." Perspective truly is powerful. We can choose to see things in a negative light or a positive light.

Bad things will happen in life, but good things will happen as well. We must understand that life is full of ups and downs, and that there will be certain things we can't control. It's this understanding that will help us step out of our comfort zone. Like the famous Steve Jobs said,<br><span class="w3-blockquote"> "You're already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."</span> <br>It's our decision to see every moment no matter how good or bad as a crucial part of our journey here on earth is what will allow us to live our life to the fullest.
              <div class="center">
            <img  src="../Movie/intersteller/happen.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4. Effect of time dialation could be catastrophic </h2>
            One of the major premises at the crux of the movie's plot is the theory of time dilation. The astronauts in the movie age much slower than their counterparts on Earth, owing to the effects of time dilation. This is something theorized by Albert Einstein. It dictates that as people travel nearer to the speed of light, time goes slower, something that was experimentally proven on Earth. While the people on Earth would age at a rapid pace, you could not age at all.
            <div class="center">
            <img  src="../Movie/intersteller/time.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4. Diversity can save earth in future </h2>
            Interstellar doesn’t go into details of how Earth becomes uninhabitable, but there are clues hinting at a slow-motion agricultural-blight-meets-climate-change apocalypse. Peppered through the film are scenes from The Dust Bowl, a Ken Burns documentary about Americans who had to flee their homes or succumb to starvation and “dust pneumonia” in the 1930s, thanks to decades of poor agricultural practices. Something similar is happening to Cooper’s land.

Research shows that the greater a population’s genetic diversity, the more disease-resistant it will be. That goes for plants, too. On a larger scale, ecosystems made up of numerous types of species tend to be more resilient. But Cooper and his neighbors only grow corn—because nothing else will grow. Crop rotation? Nope. There’s nothing to rotate in this monoculture. Laid out on the dinner table in one scene are corn-on-the-cob, cornbread, and corn fritters. That’s not a healthy diet, and what little remains of the human population is not thriving.
            <div class="center">
            <img  src="../Movie/intersteller/diversity.jpg " alt="love">
            </div>
            <h2 class="w3-text-blue">4. Always follow your heart,instict and passion </h2>
            Love what you do is all you need . As  steve jobs  has Quoted <br>
            <span class="w3-blockquote">Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.</span><br>
            In the movie, Cooper was the world’s best pilot but his family situation forced him to work on the farm.It was only after he found out about this big mission to save the world, that he was really in his flow and really started to do what he was born do to.Many times, we get stuck in our lives and don’t have the courage to pursue our goals and passions due to what others will think about it.
